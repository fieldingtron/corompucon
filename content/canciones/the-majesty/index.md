When I gaze into the night skies and see the work of your fingers
The moon and stars suspended in space
O what is man (O what is man?)
That you are mindful of him? 

You have given him a crown of glory and honor
And have made him a little lower than the angels.
You have put him in charge of all creation
The beasts of the field
The birds of the air
The fish of the sea

But what is man (O what is man?)
O what is man that you are mindful of him? 

O Lord Our God 
The majesty and glory of your name
Transcends the earth
And fills the heavens.

O Lord Our God
Little children praise you perfectly
And so would we
And so would we.
